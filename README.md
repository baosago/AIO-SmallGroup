# AIO-SmallGroup-Projects

Showcase the projects our 5-member team will develop as part of the AIO 2025 modules.
1. English/Vietnamese RAG Assistant:
This project explores how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Large Language Models (LLMs), which are models capable of generating text-based responses to user queries. Popular examples include ChatGPT and Gemini.
RAG enhances LLM performance by incorporating information retrieved from external documents to provide more accurate answers. In this project, we apply RAG to answer questions based on learning materials from the AIO course.
Input: A course document and a related user question.
Output: A text-based answer generated using the document content.
